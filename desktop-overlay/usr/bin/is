Welcome to IS Information System GNU/Linux.
IS brings a set of commands to provide relevant information about our GNU/Linux system, with: memory, processor, BIOS, partitions, PCI devices, etc.

e - EXIT IS
"clear && kill -9 -$PPID"
This will exit IS and closes the sakura terminal.

i - INFORMATION IS
Display this information page.

1- MEMORY SUMMARY	
You can also use the dmidecode utility to extract hardware information by reading data from the DMI tables. This option collects information from memory.

2- BIOS EXPLORE
You can also use the dmidecode utility to extract hardware information by reading data from the DMI tables. This option collects information from BIOS.

3- PROCESSOR COLLECT
You can also use the dmidecode utility to extract hardware information by reading data from the DMI tables. This option collects information from processor.

4- SYSTEM LIST 
You can also use the dmidecode utility to extract hardware information by reading data from the DMI tables. This option collects information from system.

5- PARTITIONS
Although the main functionality of “fdisk” command is to modify file system partitions, it can also be used to view information about the different partitions on your file system.

6- DF DISK SPACE
The “df” command stand for disk filesystem, it is used to get full summary of available and used disk space usage of file system on Linux system.

7- DISK USAGE
Disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface. This option will examine the root partition.

8- HOME FOLDER USAGE
Disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface. This option will examine the home partition.

9- BLOCK DEVICES
The “lsblk” command is used to report information about block devices

10- PCI DEVICES       
The “lspci” tool is used to generate information concerning all PCI controllers on your system plus the devices that are connected to them.

11- HARDWARE LISTER          
The “lshw” command is a relatively small tool and there are few options that you can use with it while extracting information. The information provided by “lshw” gathered form different /proc files.

12- INXI 
Inxi is a set of scripts that will detect a whole lot of information about the hardware, including vendor details, device driver configuration, etc.

13- SCREENFETCH    
screenFetch is a "Bash Screenshot Information Tool". This handy Bash script can be used to generate one of those nifty terminal theme information + ASCII distribution logos you see in everyone's screenshots nowadays.	            

14- PSTREE PID
pstree shows running processes as a tree. The tree is rooted at either pid or init if pid is omitted. If a user name is specified, all process trees rooted at processes owned by that user are shown.

15- PS CPU
Report a snapshot of the current processes. The command ps aux –sort=-pcpu sort the processes in order of CPU usage.

16- TOP PROCESSES
The top command in Linux displays the processes running on the system. One of the most important tools for a system administrator.

17- MEMORY USAGE    
The “ps_mem” command provides current memory usage information. The information is: Private + Shared = RAM used Program   

18- TEMPERATURE DISK
The “hddtem” command gives you the temperature of your hard drive

19- TEMPERATURE PROCESSOR
Collection of user space tools for general SMBus access and hardware monitoring.

20- BOOT-UP PERFORMANCE
The “systemd-analyze plot” prints a list of all running units, ordered by the time they took to initialize. This information may be used to optimize boot-up times. Note that the output might be misleading as the initialization of one service might be slow simply because it waits for the initialization of another service to complete.

21- SMART DISK
SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) is a supplementary component built into many modern storage devices through which devices monitor, store, and analyze the health of their operation. 

22- SYSTEMD STATUS
The systemd is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. It provides a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system. The “systemctl status”
command show system status using.

23- SYSTEMD RUNNING 
The systemd is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. It provides a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system. The “systemctl list-units“ command list running units.

24- FIREWALL STATUS
Checks the state of the firewall  ufw. Uncomplicated and easy to use CLI tool for managing a netfilter firewall.

25- HackerWatch
It offers some services to analyze the connectivity of the PC to the internet.
